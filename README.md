# SkinSense Database
Project created for course OOP in Java at Warsaw University of Technology (http://java.fizyka.pw.edu.pl/).  
The program allows you to view the database of skin allergy tests carried out on a sample of 100 patients.\
Courtesy of the MILTON ESSEX SA consortium, program uses real data from test of new optoelectronics system for noninvasive imaging in clinical applications (http://miltonessex.eu/). \
User can compare images before and after test and generate PDF report with comments. The program also allows to sort and filter patient data.
